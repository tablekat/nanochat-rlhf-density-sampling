# Memory Requirements Analysis: Density-Aware Sampling

**TL;DR:** ✅ **Online computation is FINE for your current dataset.** You need ~10 GB peak RAM. No offline precomputation necessary. If you scale to millions of prompts later, switch to offline + FAISS-based k-NN.

## Detailed RAM Breakdown

### 1. Embeddings Storage: **5.25 GB**

```
28,000 prompts × 50,304 dimensions × 4 bytes/float32
= 5,634,048,000 bytes
= 5.25 GB
```

**Why 50,304 dimensions?**

- The code uses model logits as embeddings, not hidden states
- Logits shape after forward pass: `[batch, seq_len, vocab_size]`
- After average pooling: `[batch, vocab_size]`
- Each prompt → 50,304-dim vector

**Memory breakdown during embedding computation:**

```
Batch 1 (8 prompts):     32 MB in VRAM
Batch 2 (8 prompts):     32 MB in VRAM
...
Batch 3500 (8 prompts):  32 MB in VRAM
```

Processed sequentially, so only 1 batch in VRAM at a time. Then all 28k transferred to CPU → single 5.25 GB array.

### 2. k-NN Index Storage (temporary): **0.03 GB**

During k-NN computation:

```
Distances array:  28,000 × 11 × 8 bytes (float64) = 2.46 MB
Indices array:    28,000 × 11 × 4 bytes (int32)   = 1.23 MB
Total:            ≈ 3.7 MB
```

**Duration:** ~1-2 seconds during `nbrs.kneighbors()` call, then freed

### 3. Density Weights (final): **0.0001 GB**

```
28,000 weights × 4 bytes/float32 = 112 KB
```

Stored in RAM for the entire training run.

### 4. Model in GPU Memory: **2-3 GB**

```
Model weights:     ~1.5 GB (12 layers, 768 hidden)
Optimizer state:   ~0.5 GB (if using Adam)
Forward buffers:   ~0.2 GB (intermediate activations)
Total:             ~2-3 GB
```

## Peak Memory Timeline

```
START:
├─ Load prompts from disk:        50-100 MB
├─ Load base model to GPU:        2-3 GB
│  └─ GPU memory now:             2-3 GB

│
├─ Convert to numpy:               negligible
├─ Build k-NN index:

│  └─ Get distances/indices:      temporary, freed
│
├─ Compute weights:
│  ├─ 1/density calculation:      negligible
│  ├─ Normalization:              negligible
│  └─ Weights stored:             112 KB
│
└─ Final state:
   ├─ GPU: Model (2-3 GB)
   ├─ CPU: Embeddings freed after k-NN
   └─ RAM: Weights only (112 KB)
```

**Peak RAM usage:** **10.25 GB** (all systems combined)

## Scaling Analysis: What About Millions of Prompts?

```
Prompts    | Embedding Size | + Model | Total | Status
-----------|----------------|---------|-------|--------
28,000     | 5.25 GB        | 2-3 GB  | 7.2   | ✅
280,000    | 52.5 GB        | 2-3 GB  | 54.5  | ❌ (needs OFFLINE)
2.8M       | 525 GB         | 2-3 GB  | 526.7 | ❌ (needs OFFLINE)
28M        | 5.2 TB         | 2-3 GB  | 5,249 | ❌ (needs OFFLINE)
```

**Your current dataset is right at the inflection point** where online works, but just barely wouldn't if scaled by 10x.

## Online vs Offline: Detailed Comparison

### **ONLINE (Current Implementation)**

```
kat_train_grpo.py
├─ Load base model
├─ Load prompts from disk
├─ DensityAwareSampler.__init__():
│  ├─ _compute_embeddings_from_model()      ← ONLINE
│  └─ _compute_inverse_density_weights()
└─ Start training with weighted sampler
```

**Pros:**

- ✅ Embeddings are **fresh** from base model (not stale)
- ✅ No preprocessing step needed
- ✅ Single entry point: just run `kat_train_grpo.py`
- ✅ Memory efficient for current dataset size

**Cons:**

- ❌ **3-minute startup delay** at training initialization
- ❌ Peak RAM spike during embedding computation
- ❌ Cannot scale beyond ~300k prompts

**Memory timeline:**

```
t=0s:    2-3 GB (model only)
t=5s:    5.25 GB (embeddings added)
t=180s:  5.25 GB (k-NN computed)
t=185s:  10.25 GB peak
t=186s:  5.25 GB (training starts)
```

---

### **OFFLINE (Alternative for Future Scaling)**

```
kat_compute_embeddings.py (preprocessing step)
├─ Load base model
├─ Compute embeddings in batches
└─ Save to embeddings.npy + metadata.json

kat_train_grpo.py (main training)
├─ Load embeddings.npy (no model needed!)
├─ Compute k-NN
└─ Start training immediately
```

**Pros:**

- ✅ **Training starts instantly** (no 3-min delay)
- ✅ Scales to **millions** of prompts easily
- ✅ Only loads embeddings during training (5.25 GB), not model (2-3 GB)
- ✅ Can run offline preprocessing on CPU while GPU trains other models
- ✅ Reproducible (save embeddings, always get same results)

**Cons:**

- ❌ Extra preprocessing step
- ❌ Embeddings become **stale** (not from latest model)
- ❌ 5.25 GB file on disk (but only 2.5 GB compressed)
- ❌ More complex workflow (2 scripts instead of 1)

**Memory timeline:**

```
Preprocessing:
t=0s:    2-3 GB (model only)
t=5s:    5.25 GB (embeddings) → save to disk
t=185s:  Done. Disk: 2.5 GB (compressed)

Training:
t=0s:    5.25 GB (load from disk)
t=1s:    5.25 GB (k-NN computed)
t=2s:    5.25 GB (training starts)
```

## What Does "Online" Actually Mean?

In `DensityAwareSampler._compute_embeddings_from_model()`:

```python
# This line means "online" (happens during training init):
outputs = self.base_model(input_tensor)  # Forward pass through model

# NOT pre-computed from disk:
# embeddings = np.load("embeddings.npy")  # This would be offline
```

So embeddings are **computed fresh** from the base model weights at training start, not loaded from a pre-computed file.

---

## Recommendation for Your Project

### **For 28,000 prompts (current):**

```
✅ USE ONLINE (current implementation)
   - Memory: 10.25 GB (fits in 24GB GPU easily)
   - Time: 3-minute startup (one-time)
   - Quality: Embeddings fresh from model
   - Simplicity: Single script, no preprocessing
```

### **If you scale to 280,000 prompts:**

```
❌ STOP using online
→ IMPLEMENT offline + FAISS-based k-NN:

  1. Preprocessing step:
     python kat_compute_embeddings.py --base_model_source base
     └─ Creates embeddings.npy (2.5 GB compressed)

  2. Load existing embeddings in kat_train_grpo.py:
     if args.use_precomputed_embeddings:
         embeddings = np.load("embeddings.npy")  # 5.25 GB
     else:
         embeddings = compute_online()  # current code

  3. Use FAISS for k-NN on 280k embeddings:
     import faiss
     index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(embedding_dim)
     index.add(embeddings)
     distances, indices = index.search(embeddings, k=10)
     └─ Much faster than sklearn NearestNeighbors
     └─ Better memory efficiency
```

### **If you scale to millions of prompts:**

```
❌ DEFINITELY need offline + streaming k-NN:

  1. Compute embeddings in chunks (100k at a time)
  2. Save to disk in HDF5 or Parquet (efficient format)
  3. Build FAISS index incrementally:
     index = faiss.IndexIVFFlat(...)  # Inverted index for scaling
  4. Stream embeddings during training
```

---

## Current Code: Is It Safe?

**Yes, checking line-by-line:**

```python
# Line 71-72: Embeddings computed in batches of 8
batch_size = 8
for i in range(0, len(prompts), batch_size):

# ✅ SAFE: only 8 prompts in GPU memory at once
```

```python
# Line 103: Move to CPU after each batch
embeddings.append(batch_emb.cpu().numpy())

# ✅ SAFE: GPU memory freed after each batch
```

```python
# Line 105: Concatenate on CPU
embeddings = np.concatenate(embeddings, axis=0)

# ✅ SAFE: concatenation happens on CPU (5.25 GB is fine)
```

```python
# Line 126: Build k-NN index
nbrs = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=self.k+1)
nbrs.fit(self.embeddings)

# ✅ SAFE: sklearn's NearestNeighbors is memory-efficient
# Index building adds minimal memory overhead
```

**Result:** ✅ **Code is safe and memory-conscious!**

---

## Monitoring During Training

If you're concerned about memory, add monitoring:

```python
import psutil
import torch

def check_memory():
    cpu_mem = psutil.virtual_memory().used / (1024**3)
    gpu_mem = torch.cuda.memory_allocated() / (1024**3)
    print(f"CPU: {cpu_mem:.1f} GB, GPU: {gpu_mem:.1f} GB")

# During training init:
print("Before DensityAwareSampler:")
check_memory()

sampler = DensityAwareSampler(...)

print("After DensityAwareSampler:")
check_memory()
```

## Next Steps

**Right now:** Nothing - your current online approach is perfect ✅

**If scaling up:**

1. Add `--use_precomputed_embeddings` flag to `kat_train_grpo.py`
2. Create separate `kat_compute_embeddings_offline.py` script
3. Integrate FAISS for faster k-NN on large datasets

**Optional improvement (even now):**

- Add memory monitoring to training startup
- Print embedding/k-NN timing for transparency
